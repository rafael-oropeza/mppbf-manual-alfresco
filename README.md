# How to install Alfresco 5.0.a Community Edition on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

After the development of my most viewed post sharing [how to install Alfresco 4.2.c on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS](http://fcorti.com/2013/01/09/installation-alfresco-4-2-c-on-ubuntu/) (more than 35.000 views) and Windows Server 2008 R2 (more that 13.000 views), it’s time to update the tutorial to the newest major version of Alfresco: **Alfresco Community Edition 5.0.a.** Even if the 5-th version is quite different from the 4-th version, the installation process is more or less the same… but let’s describe exactly the differences. The operating system choosen for the tutorial is [Ubuntu 14.04.01 LTS.](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

Differently from the other post, the tutorial is separated in two parts: the installation of the dependencies and the Alfresco installation. As we like and prefer, the installation is a step by step list of commands and tasks: simpler to understand, to do and to test. Hope you’ll be agree.

The handbook is divided into two parts.

Part 1 – Installation of the dependencies

---

Part one broadly describes the practice of front-end engineering.

Part 2 – Installation of Alfresco

---

Part two identifies self-directed and direct resources for learning to become a front-end developer.

Part III: Front-End Development Tools

---

Part three briefly explains and identifies tools of the trade.
