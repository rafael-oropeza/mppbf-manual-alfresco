#Sensors


Below the sensors included in [Erle-Brain](http://erlerobot.com) are described:

### Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)

| **Sensor**   | **Features** |
|----|---------|
| *MPU6000* |  3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer. I2C and SPI|
| *MPU9250* | 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer. I2C and SPI |
| *LSM9DS0* | 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer. I2C and SPI|

### Barometers

| **Sensor**   | **Features** |
|----|---------|
| * MS5611-01BA03* | Barometer. SPI |
| *BMP250* | Barometer. SPI |


### Why so many sensors?

Well, think about the possibilities of using new algorithms and control techniques with many sources of information.

We believe that the lack of precision can be greatly compensated with the quantity we provide achieving both an affordable price and amazing results ;).
