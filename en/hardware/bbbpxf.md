The [PixHawk Fire Cape](https://github.com/diydrones/PXF) (PXF) is a cape for the BeagleBone Black developed by Philip Rowse. The board is used to support the `AP_HAL_Linux` of ardupilot.

This cape contains all the needed sensors to fly. Also contains buses connectors to plug additional hardware you would like: buzzer, GPS, leds, ...

Once the board has booted (and you've logged in, which usually is done using `ssh root@192.168.7.2`) you should verify that all the sensors are working properly.
