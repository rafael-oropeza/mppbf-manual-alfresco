# ArduRover


`APMrover2` was originally derived from
ArduPlane by Jean-Louis Naudin (JLN), and then rewritten after the `AP_HAL` merge by Andrew Tridgell.

 The ArduPilot Mega (APM) is an autopilot to control fixed-wing aircraft.
`APMrover2` provides an autopilot for rovers.This allows rovers to follow an
autonomous recognition mission following a navigation plan.

This section will introduce `APMrover2` the rover flavour of ArduPilot.
