# Linux
**Linux** is a [Unix-Like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the [Linux Kernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) an operating system kernel first released on 5 October 1992 by [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for intel x66 based personal computers. It has since been ported to more hardware platforms than any other operating system.

Linux also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailores to the system (this includes our board, mobiles devices, tablets or video game consoles)
