# Robot Operative System (ROS)
[ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) (*Robot Operating System*) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create **robot applications**. It is a [Robotics middleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics_middleware) providing operating system-like functionality on a heterogeneous computer. ROS provides standard operating system services such as hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, implementation of commonly used functionality (message-passing between processes), package management, and more. Despite the importance of reactivity and low latency in robot control, ROS is not a [Realtime OS](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system), though it is possible to integrate ROS with realtime code.

ROS ecosystem can be separated into three groups:
* Language
* ROS client library implementations such as [roscpp](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp) [rospy](http://wiki.ros.org/rospy) and [roslisp](http://wiki.ros.org/roslisp)
* Packages containin applications-related code which uses one or more ROS [client-libraries](http://wiki.ros.org/Client%20Libraries)
